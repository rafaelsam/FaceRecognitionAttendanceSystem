## ‚ú® Features
- **Face Recognition** - Makes it an MVP app
- **Attendees list** - Shows a list of attendees that are present on that particular day
- **Progress** - To check the monthly attendance progress and consistency
- **PDF** - Admin can add PDFs and anyone can download it, comes in handy when sharing important pdfs, previours year papers and so on
- **Study timer** - This needs the DND Access, it's a timer that monitors how long you study and turns on silent mode when started
- **Study progress** - This shows how long you studied each day for the past 7 days and this helps your to check your progress

## ‚ùì How to use the app?
- Download the app  - [**PresIN**](https://github.com/binayshaw7777/Face-Recognition_Engage-2022/blob/master/app/release/app-release.apk)
- Create an account -> Register by adding your face and all the required details asked (Login as Admin to test all the features)
- Verify your Email
- Signin to your account and mark your attendance.
- Follow this video for reference - <br />
- **Important** (Before deleteing your account from Firebase Authentication, logout first and delete the Firebase Realtime Database of your userID Node)


## üç¥ Fork/Clone the project
- Clone the repository by the following link and open the project in Android Studio or Git Bash
- ```bash
  https://github.com/binayshaw7777/Face-Recognition_Engage-2022.git
- Connect it to your Firebase Account
- Add Email Authentication, Realtime Database and Firebase Storage.
- Follow the above steps to create account and proceed
- **Important** (Before deleteing your account from Firebase Authentication, logout first and delete the Firebase Realtime Database of your userID Node)

## ü§î How it works?
- Intialially during registration the user's face embeddings is stored in a HashMap as value with a key that is same of all users "added".<br />
- Then after signin in, the key "added" is replaced with the userID -> <UserID, Embeddings> and stored in the user's Node<br />
- These node from users is then used during facial recognition<br />
- During facial recognition, the embeddings obtained from the person in the camera is used to calculate the euclidean distance between the person and the list of embeddings in the Firebase   RealTime Database.<br />
- If the distance is less than 1.0f and also the Key -> userID of the same hashmap is matched with the current logged in userID then it is success, the attendance is marked.<br />
